<hr><p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; margin-bottm:50px;">Sri Aditya Educational Society (ESTD-2000) started a Technical Institution to impart highest quality and standards in the north coastal A.P. under aegis of eminent academicians, educationists and professionals in the name of Aditya Institute of Technology and Management in 2001. <br>    
<h3 style="text-align:left">Our Vision</h3> <p style="text-align:left">
To become a pioneer in providing high quality education and research in the area of computer science and engineering. </p>
<h3 style="text-align:left">Our Mission </h3> 

•Enrich society and advance computer science and engineering by preparing graduates with the knowledge, ability, and skill to become innovators and leaders who are able to contribute to the aspirations of the country and society.<br>
•Share knowledge and expertise to benefit the country, the region, and beyond while inspiring people to engage in computing fields. <br>


<h3 style="text-align:left" >POs & PSOs</h3>
<p style="text-align:center";>Program Outcomes<br> 
1.ENGINEERING KNOWLEDGE: Apply the knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering fundamentals, and an engineering specialization to the solution of complex engineering problems.<br> 
2.PROBLEM ANALYSIS: Identify, formulate, review research literature, and analyze complex engineering problems reaching substantiated conclusions using first principles of mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering sciences. <br> 

3.DESIGN/DEVELOPMENT OF SOLUTIONS: Design solutions for complex engineering problems and design system components or processes that meet the specified needs with appropriate consideration for the public health and safety, and the cultural, societal, and environmental considerations. <br> 

4.CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS OF COMPLEX PROBLEMS: Use research-based knowledge and research methods including design of experiments, analysis and interpretation of data, and synthesis of the information to provide valid conclusions. <br> 

5.MODERN TOOL USAGE: Create, select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern engineering and IT tools including prediction and modelling to complex engineering activities with an understanding of the limitations. <br> 

6.THE ENGINEER AND SOCIETY: Apply reasoning informed by the contextual knowledge to assess societal, health, safety, legal and cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to the professional engineering practice. <br> 

7.ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY: Understand the impact of the professional engineering solutions in societal and environmental contexts, and demonstrate the knowledge of, and need for sustainable development. <br> 

8.ETHICS: Apply ethical principles and commit to professional ethics and responsibilities and norms of the engineering practice. <br> 

9.INDIVIDUAL AND TEAM WORK: Function effectively as an individual, and as a member or leader in diverse teams, and in multidisciplinary settings. <br> 

10.COMMUNICATION: Communicate effectively on complex engineering activities with the engineering community and with society at large, such as, being able to comprehend and write effective reports and design documentation, make effective presentations, and give and receive clear instructions. <br> 

11.PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND FINANCE: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the engineering and management principles and apply these to one’s own work, as a member and leader in a team, to manage projects and in multidisciplinary environments. <br> 

12.LIFE-LONG LEARNING: Recognize the need for, and have the preparation and ability to engage in independent and life-long learning in the broadest context of technological change.<br>
